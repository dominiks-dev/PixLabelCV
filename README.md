# PixLabelCV 
PixLabelCV is a C++ application for offline, pixel-precise image labeling for semantic segmentation. It designed utilizing an iterative approach using common computer vision algorithms (OpenCV functions) and Dear ImGui for the graphical user interface.

## Features

- Offline image labeling
- Intuitive GUI built with Dear ImGui
- High performance by running image processing and graphis discplay algorithms on the graphics card using C++, Direct3D and OpenCV
- Advanced computer vision algorithms for efficient labeling
- Unique pixel assignment to eliminate overlap-induced ambiguities

## Design and Usage

PixLabelCV offers a unique approach to image labeling by integrating conventional techniques with advanced computer vision algorithms, including Watershed, flood-fill and GrabCut. Unlike other software, it performs segmentation in the chosen region of interest (ROI) within milliseconds, generating a preliminary class mask. If the mask meets the annotator's needs, it can be added to the overall image mask. This iterative process continues until the entire image is labeled.

PixLabelCV combines traditional labeling methods, like rectangles and polygons, with computer vision algorithms ranging from basic thresholding to complex procedures like flood fill and watershed. The tool instantaneously computes and displays segmentations, which annotators can quickly add to a class label or refine by adjusting parameters. Features like morphological closing and unique pixel assignment enhance the user experience by eliminating overlap-induced ambiguities and making the labeling process more intuitive.
